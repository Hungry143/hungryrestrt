<h2>TradingView does not store your payment credentials. They are encrypted and passed to PayPal and Braintree through their API that we use to process all payments. This API allows us to create a protected link to the payment method, if the card was used to purchase anything on our website and the transaction was successful. Thus we are able to provide you with an easy and secure way to purchase anything else in two clicks on our site.</h2>
